# Moving-Average-Filter-Project
In this MATLAB project, I designed a moving average filter to first filter out a provided noisy ECG Signal and then a noisy PPG signal exported from an excel sheet.
This project was done for Dr. Khoubroy's Signals and Systems class at the University of Texas at Dallas
